# Anomaly-detection-in-Manufacturing
Deep learning is a part of machine learning and is well applied in many areas with messy and unstructured data such as pictures. 
The inspection in industries manufacturing is an essential requirement because outlier or anomaly can be detected on product manufacturing. Done in the efficient way, that mean by introducing the machine learning and deep learning in the process of anomaly detection, the productivity and the quality of the product can be improved. 

- In this project we performed therefore the Convolutional autoencoder and the semantic segmentation methods like U-Net and FCN and we compared them with each other to see which one is the most performant.

Our objective was to show that the automation of this process is feasible and to show how it is possible by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. By doing so, we have built models based on the CNN architecture such as the fully convolutional natural network, the U-Net 2D which are segmentation methods, and the convolutional auto encoder. Then want to evaluate the performance of these models using metrics such as the Intersection Over Union or IoU, the dice coefficient, thee recall, the precision and the F1 score for semantic segmentation, and the reconstruction loss obtained using the SSIM loss function for the CAE.

Deep Learning Models:
- CNN
- FCNN 
- U-Net 2D (segmentation method)
- CAE

A lot of thank you to my team partner
